# G10 Shader Compiler

The G10 shader compiler is a simple program for compiling and recompiling Vulkan graphics shaders. The "Path" text box is autofilled when the application starts, using the environment variable ```G10_SOURCE_PATH```. Shader output is placed in the same ```Path``` as the source code, with the file extension ```.spv```.
